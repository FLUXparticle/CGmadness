MinGW:

	download MinGW, MSYS and msysDTK from http://www.mingw.org/
	and install in this order

	download "GLUT for MinGW" from http://mywebpage.netscape.com/PtrPck/glut.htm
	extract include/ and lib/ into MinGW directory
	extract glut32.dll into "CG Madness" source directory or windows/system32

	download "GLEW"-source from http://glew.sourceforge.net/
	start msys
	install from glew source directory with "make install GLEW_DEST=/mingw"
	you may need to copy glew32.dll from /mingw/bin 
	  into "CG Madness" source directory or windows/system32 to play without MSYS

	now you can go into "CG Madness" source directory and build with "make"

Cygwin:

	install cygwin with gcc, make, etc. from http://www.cygwin.com/

	download "GLUT for MinGW" from http://mywebpage.netscape.com/PtrPck/glut.htm
	extract content of include/ into cygwin/usr/include/w32api/ directory
	extract content of lib/ into cygwin/lib/w32api/ directory
	extract glut32.dll into "CG Madness" source directory or windows/system32

	download "GLEW"-source from http://glew.sourceforge.net/
	start cygwin
	go into glew source directory
	build glew with "make CFLAGS.EXTRA=-mno-cygwin LDFLAGS.EXTRA=-mno-cygwin SYSTEM=mingw"
	copy content of glew/include into cygwin/usr/include/w32api/
	copy content of glew/lib into cygwin/lib/w32api/
	also copy glew/lib/glew32.dll into "CG Madness" source directory or windows/system32

	now you can go into "CG Madness" source directory and build with "make"

Linux:

	required packages: freeglut3-dev libglew-dev (or equivalent)

	to build just go into source directory and type "make"

Mac OS X: (tested on PowerBook G4/Leopard)

	In order to compile cgmadness you need glew. An easy way is to download
	and install it through DarwinPorts: http://darwinports.com/download/

	Open the Terminal.app and enter
		sudo port install glew

	In the cgmadness source dir type
		make
	to build cgmadness
